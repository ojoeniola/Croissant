        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named
        for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
        then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
        similar to a puff pastry.
